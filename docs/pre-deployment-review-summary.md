## 🚀 Pre-Deployment Action Items

### Required Before Production (High Priority)
1. **Configure Production Environment Variables** in Vercel Dashboard:
   - `SQUARE_ENV=production`
   - `SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN=<production_token>`
   - `SQUARE_LOCATION_ID=<production_location>`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SQUARE_APPLICATION_ID=<production_app_id>`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SQUARE_LOCATION_ID=<production_location>`
   - `AUTH_SECRET=<32_char_random_string>`
   - `ADMIN_EMAILS=admin@yourdomain.com`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://your-domain.com`

2. **Configure Custom Domain** in Vercel:
   - Set up custom domain
   - Verify SSL certificate
   - Configure DNS records

3. **Enable Monitoring Services** (Optional):
   - Set up Sentry production project and configure DSN
   - Configure Resend for email notifications
   - Set up any additional analytics

### Recommended (Medium Priority)
1. **Content Review**:
   - Verify all product data is current
   - Check admin user accounts
   - Remove any test/demo content

2. **Testing**:
   - Cross-browser testing
   - Mobile device testing
   - Payment flow testing with real Square credentials
